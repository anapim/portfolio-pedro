        "description": "After completing the soundtrack to the video game Noct I created and implemented the sound design for the game. A very experimental mix of sounds meant to create an unsettling atmosphere to the satellite view visuals of the game. The sounds of analogue equipment were recreated to make the player feel like all the action is viewed and handled through old equipment. This was my first work with video game sound design. The game was produced in the Unity engine.",

This album presented a simpler approach to ambient and experimental music in comparison to the later releases. A lot of still sounds and exploration in transmitting the sensation of big spaces. Sudden transitions of mood and uncanny sounds.",
